### 문제 설명

<p>The Minions have found that El Macho and other super-villains use a different calendar than the rest of us. Their calendar has 13 months that each have 28 days (thus the 13 months cover a total of 364 days). The remaining 1 or 2 days of the year (depending on whether it is leap year or not) are used as a vacation before starting the next year of evil. The Minions need you to implement a method that will convert a date from the regular calendar into a date on the super-villain calendar.</p>

<p>The Minions have provided you with the following reminders:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Non-leap years have the following days per month: 31, 28, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31.</li>
	<li>A leap year has 29 days in the second month and is defined as any year that is evenly divisible by 4 as long as that year is NOT evenly divisible by 100 UNLESS that year is also evenly divisible by 400.</li>
</ul>

<p>Your task is to write a program that will read in a series of dates from the standard calendar and convert them to the super-villain calendar and print the new date. The provided skeleton handles the input of the dates and the output messages.</p>

### 입력 

 <p>The first line in the test data file contains the number of test cases (≤ 100). After that each line will contain one date from the regular calendar in “YYYY MM DD” format. You can assume that you will only be provided with correct dates.</p>

### 출력 

 <p>For each test case, the program should display the date from the regular calendar and the date as it would appear on the super-villain calendar. The exact format is shown below.</p>
