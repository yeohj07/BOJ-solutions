### 문제 설명

<p>Alice took a clean sheet of paper and drew h horizontal and v vertical lines onto the paper.</p>

<p>The horizontal lines have y-coordinates y<sub>1</sub>, . . . , y<sub>h</sub>, and the vertical lines have x-coordinates x<sub>1</sub>, . . . , x<sub>v</sub>.</p>

<p>Given these coordinates, count the number of squares that appeared on the paper.</p>

<p>(The whole boundary of the square has to be drawn. The inside of the square does not have to be empty.)</p>

### 입력 

 <p>The first line of input contains the integers h and v (0 ≤ h, v ≤ 1500).</p>

<p>The second line of input contains a strictly increasing sequence consisting of h space-separated integers: y<sub>1</sub>, . . . , y<sub>h</sub>.</p>

<p>The third line of input contains a strictly increasing sequence consisting of v space-separated integers: x<sub>1</sub>, . . . , x<sub>v</sub>.</p>

<p>All horizontal and vertical coordinates are between 0 and 2<sup>30</sup>, inclusive.</p>

### 출력 

 <p>Output a single line with a single integer: the total number of squares.</p>
