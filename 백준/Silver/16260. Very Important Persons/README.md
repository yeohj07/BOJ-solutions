The guests must be arranged according to their importance, there must be no situation that a guest with greater number is seating further from the mayor than a guest with smaller number. The distance between two seats (r<sub>1</sub>, s<sub>1</sub>) and (r<sub>2</sub>, s<sub>2</sub>) is measured as |r<sub>1</sub> - r<sub>2</sub>| + |s<sub>1</sub> - s<sub>2</sub>|.</p>
