### 문제 설명

<p>A total of 12 of Farmer John's cows are attending the winter Moolympic games this year, each with an integer skill level between 1 and 1,000,000.</p><p>Farmer John wants to divide them into 4 teams of 3, so that the teams come out reasonably "balanced" in terms of total skill (the skill level of a team is just the sum of the skill levels of the cows on the team). Specifically, he wants to minimize S - s, where S and s are the maximum and minimum skill levels of the teams.  This ensures that the variation between the most-skilled and least-skilled teams is as small as possible.</p><p>Please help Farmer John determine the minimum possible value of S - s.</p>
