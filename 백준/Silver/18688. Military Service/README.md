### 문제 설명

<p>You have just started your military service with the border guards. Since you are a Computer Science graduate, they asked you to implement a schedule for the soldiers. Initially no soldier is on duty and you need the schedule to satisfy 2 requirements:</p>

<ul>
	<li>There are N soldiers, each soldier can be on duty for at most K continuous months and then he must take one month of vacation.</li>
	<li>The schedule needs to make sure that the guaranteed minimum number of soldiers on duty at any given time is maximized.</li>
</ul>

<p>Given N and K, the system will calculate the maximum guaranteed number of soldiers to be on duty at any given time.</p>

### 입력 

 <p>Your program will be tested on one or more test cases. The first line of the input will be a single integer T, the number of test cases (1 ≤ T ≤ 100).</p>

<p>Each test case consists of a line containing 2 space separated integers:</p>

<ul>
	<li>N: The number of soldiers (0 ≤ N ≤ 10, 000, 000)</li>
	<li>K: The number of continuous months a soldier can be on duty before they have to take a month of vacation (0 ≤ K ≤ 10, 000, 000).</li>
</ul>

### 출력 

 <p>For each test case, print a single line containing the maximum guaranteed number of soldiers on duty at any given time.</p>
