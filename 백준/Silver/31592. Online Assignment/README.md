### 문제 설명

<p>You have to finish an assignment by the end of today. You can submit the assignment online and, even if your submission is rejected, you still have several more submission chances.</p>

<p>The assignment consists of five questions, each of which asks whether or not a given statement is true. For each submission, you have to submit answers for all five questions. If your answers are correct for all the questions, your assignment is completed. However, if any of your answers are wrong, your submission is rejected, and the number of correct answers will be told.</p>

<p>All the questions are so difficult that you cannot give confident answers to any of them. Your task here is to write a program that tries to submit answers repeatedly until the assignment is completed. Note that you can submit answers only a limited number of times.</p>
