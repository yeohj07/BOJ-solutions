### 문제 설명

<p>Every Thursday, the big square in front of the New Church in Delft is filled with market stands. Today, you brought your formidable cheese wheels\footnotemark{} to the market for the first time, and to optimize sales, you need to position your cheese wheels in an appealing way. From your experience of playing with blocks as a child, you know that the cheese wheels will look most appealing when they are ordered by weight, from small to large.<sup>1</sup></p>

<p>Ordering the cheese wheels would have been easy, if you had brought your highly accurate digital cheese-weighing scale. However, due to unfortunate planning at your cheese factory, you only have a balancing scale with you. The market is already starting to fill up with potential customers, so you hurriedly start comparing cheese wheels to order them from lightest to heaviest.</p>

<hr>
<p><sup>1</sup>A cheese wheel is large, circular, typically yellow, has a crust on the outside to keep the cheese inside fresh, and can weigh several kilos.</p>
