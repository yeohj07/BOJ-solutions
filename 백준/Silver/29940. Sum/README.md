### 문제 설명

<p>Consider an $N$-element strictly increasing integer sequence $A$ and an integer $S$.</p>

<p>Write a program to count the number of pairs of elements of $A$ whose sum is $S$.</p>

### 입력 

 <p>The first line of input contains $N$ and $S$, the length of the sequence and the required sum ($1 \le N \le 100\,000$, $0 \le S \le 2\,000\,000$). The following $N$ lines contain elements of the sequence, one element $A_i$ ($0 \le A_i \le 1\,000\,000$) on each line. The elements are distinct and ordered increasingly.</p>

### 출력 

 <p>The only line of output should contain the number of pairs that consist of two distinct elemets of the sequence and sum to $S$.</p>
