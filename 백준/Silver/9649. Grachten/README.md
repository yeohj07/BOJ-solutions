### 문제 설명

<p>Damn! I did not only oversleep (and today is the contest day!) but I also got stuck somewhere in Delft on my way from the hotel to the contest site. Everywhere around me are grachten, these city-canals that are part of many cities in the Netherlands. I am in a bit of hurry, because the NWERC contest starts in a few minutes.</p>

<p>To make matters even worse, some bridges in Delft are closed due to a cycling race through the city. Thus, I decided to jump over some of the grachten instead of searching for open bridges.</p>

<p>Everyone knows that computer scientists like me are good at algorithms but not very good athletes. Besides, I am a bit faint-hearted and don’t want to get wet. So I need your help to calculate the distance I have to jump over a gracht.</p>

<p>Luckily, I did attend the excursion in Delft city center yesterday, where I learned that all paving stones in Delft are squares and have the same size. This way, I can do some measurements on my side of the gracht (my units are paving stones):</p>

<p>Figure 1 – Illustration of first sample input.</p>

<p>I walked from point C to point D via points A and B while counting the paving stones.</p>

<p>Points A and C are always on the edge of the gracht. Points B and D have the same distance to the gracht. The target point T is always on the edge of the other side of the canal; it is the intersection point of the line through B and A, and the line through D and C. The angle between AT and AC is 90 degrees, and the two edges of the canal are parallel lines.</p>

<p>Please calculate the distance between A and T (necessary jump distance) for me.</p>

### 입력 

 <p>For each test case, the input consists of one line containing three positive integers that specify the distances between A and B, A and C, and B and D.</p>

<p>You may safely assume that no distance is larger than 1000 and the distance between B and D is larger than the distance between A and C.</p>

### 출력 

 <p>For each test case, print one line of output: the distance between A and T as a reduced fraction (i.e. remove all common factors of numerator and denominator).</p>
