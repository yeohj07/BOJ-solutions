### 문제 설명

<p>aGood evening, contestants.</p>

<p>If a and d are relatively prime positive integers, the arithmetic sequence beginning with a and increasing by d, i.e., a, a + d, a + 2d, a + 3d, a + 4d, ..., contains infinitely many prime numbers. This fact is known as Dirichlet's Theorem on Arithmetic Progressions, which had been conjectured by Johann Carl Friedrich Gauss (1777 - 1855) and was proved by Johann Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet (1805 - 1859) in 1837.</p>

<p>For example, the arithmetic sequence beginning with 2 and increasing by 3, i.e.,</p>

<blockquote>
<p>2, 5, 8, 11, 14, 17, 20, 23, 26, 29, 32, 35, 38, 41, 44, 47, 50, 53, 56, 59, 62, 65, 68, 71, 74, 77, 80, 83, 86, 89, 92, 95, 98, ... ,</p>
</blockquote>

<p>contains infinitely many prime numbers</p>

<blockquote>
<p>2, 5, 11, 17, 23, 29, 41, 47, 53, 59, 71, 83, 89, ... .</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Your mission, should you decide to accept it, is to write a program to find the nth prime number in this arithmetic sequence for given positive integers a, d, and n.</p>

<p>As always, should you or any of your team be tired or confused, the secretary disavow any knowledge of your actions. This judge system will self-terminate in three hours. Good luck!</p>

### 입력 

 <p>The input is a sequence of datasets. A dataset is a line containing three positive integers a, d, and n separated by a space. a and d are relatively prime. You may assume a <= 9307, d <= 346, and n <= 210.</p>

<p>The end of the input is indicated by a line containing three zeros separated by a space. It is not a dataset.</p>

### 출력 

 <p>The output should be composed of as many lines as the number of the input datasets. Each line should contain a single integer and should never contain extra characters.</p>

<p>The output integer corresponding to a dataset a, d, n should be the nth prime number among those contained in the arithmetic sequence beginning with a and increasing by d.</p>

<p>FYI, it is known that the result is always less than 10<sup>6</sup> (one million) under this input condition.</p>
