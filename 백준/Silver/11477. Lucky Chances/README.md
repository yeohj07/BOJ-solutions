### 문제 설명

<p>Lucky Chances is a lottery game. Each lottery ticket has a play field and a scratch area. The play field is a rectangular r × c field filled with numbers. The scratch area hides row and column numbers that specify the bet cell.</p>

<p>There are four possible winning directions: up, down, left and right. You win a direction if all numbers in this direction from the bet cell are strictly less than a number in the bet cell. And if the bet cell is on the edge of the grid, you win the corresponding direction automatically!</p>
