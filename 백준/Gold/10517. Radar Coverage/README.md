### 문제 설명

<p>The military wants to install a new radar to monitor three key locations whose X and Y coordinates are given on a map. The radar should be placed on a strategic location where the radar can be kept at minimum power while still monitoring all three locations. Lowering the power means reducing the circular area covered by the radar. Your goal is to find the X and Y coordinates of the location where radar should be installed.</p>

### 입력 

 <p>The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line of input is the number of test cases N(1≤N≤100). Each of the following N lines contains integer X (0≤X≤100) and integer Y (0≤Y≤100) coordinates of the three key locations. The first two integers are X and Y coordinates of the first location and so on.</p>

### 출력 

 <p>For each test case, print a single line saying “Case #n:” where n is the test case number followed by a space followed by X coordinate and a space and the Y coordinate of the best location for the radar. Your X and Y coordinates should have two decimal places.</p>
