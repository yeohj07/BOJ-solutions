### 문제 설명

<p>In golf croquet doubles, two teams of 2 play each other. Each player has their own ball which they hit when it is their turn. A turn comprises one hit of the ball. </p>

<p>There are 6 hoops which are each played twice, once in each direction, in a prescribed order. A point is scored by the first team to make the current hoop. To make a hoop, one of the team s balls must be knocked through the current hoop in the right direction. The first team to score 7 points wins. If the game reaches 6-6, a final deciding hoop is played. Note that a team cannot score more than 7 points the game ends as soon as the 7th hoop is won. </p>

<p>The balls are played in a fixed order: blue, red, black (blue s partner) then yellow (red s partner). We can record the progress of a match by recording the outcome of each shot. The code we are using is: </p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>S</strong> a standard shot that does not make a hoop</li>
	<li><strong>H</strong> a shot that makes a hoop for the team who played the shot</li>
	<li><strong>D</strong> a shot that makes 2 hoops for the team who played the shot an extremely unlikely scenario but it can happen! A team on 6 points will only score the first of the two hoops, of course.</li>
	<li><strong>O</strong> a shot that makes a hoop for an opponent s ball! </li>
</ul>

<p>The last one is almost certainly an accident, but it happens far more times than players like! </p>
