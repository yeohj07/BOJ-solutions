### 문제 설명

<p>You are trying to pass the time while at the optometrist. You notice there is a grid of four numbers:</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="" src="https://onlinejudgeimages.s3-ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/problem/17013/1.svg" style="width: 69px; height: 50px;"></p>

<p>You see lots of mirrors and lenses at the optometrist, and wonder how flipping the grid horizontally or vertically would change the grid.</p>

<p>Specifically, a "horizontal" flip (across the horizontal centre line) would take the original grid of four numbers and result in:</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="" src="https://onlinejudgeimages.s3-ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/problem/17013/2.svg" style="width: 69px; height: 50px;"></p>

<p>A "vertical" flip (across the vertical centre line) would take the original grid of four numbers and result in:</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="" src="https://onlinejudgeimages.s3-ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/problem/17013/3.svg"></p>

<p>Your task is to determine the final orientation of the numbers in the grid after a sequence of horizontal and vertical flips.</p>

### 입력 

 <p>The input consists of one line, composed of a sequence of at least one and at most 1000000 characters. Each character is either H, representing a horizontal flip, or V, representing a vertical flip.</p>

<p>For 8 of the 15 available marks, there will be at most 1000 characters in the input.</p>

### 출력 

 <p>Output the final orientation of the four numbers. Specifically, each of the two lines of output will contain two integers, separated by one space.</p>
