### 문제 설명

<p>After hearing that the quadratic formula is used constantly in calculus, you decide that it would be more efficient to just write a program for it! Write a program that solves the equation shown below:</p>

<p>$$x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$$</p>

<p>The $\pm$ sign represents two different equations, one with $+$ and one with $-$. Your answer will be both answers, separated by a comma and a space.</p>

### 입력 

 <p>The first line will contain a single integer $n$ that indicates the number of data sets that follow. Each data set will contain three numbers (integer or decimal) on a single line, representing $a$, $b$, and $c$ respectively.</p>

### 출력 

 <p>Output the two answers to the equation, rounded to the thousandths digit and separated by a comma and one space. The $+$ sign will be the first answer, then the $-$ sign will be the second. The solutions will always be real numbers.</p>
