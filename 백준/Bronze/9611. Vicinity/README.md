### 문제 설명

<p>This is one of the most basic geometry proximity problems. We are given n points in the plane and we should determine which points are in the vicinity of a particular point. </p>

<p>Let the set of points P = {p<sub>1</sub>, p<sub>2</sub> , …, p<sub>n</sub>} , where p<sub>i</sub> has coordinates (x<sub>i</sub>, y<sub>i</sub>). We use d(p<sub>i</sub>,p<sub>j</sub>) to denote the distance between the two points. A point p<sub>j</sub> is in the vicinity of point p<sub>i</sub> if d(p<sub>i</sub>,p<sub>j</sub>) ≤ d<sub>v</sub> .We may call d<sub>v</sub> the vicinity distance. Given a set of points P, point p<sub>i</sub> and d<sub>v</sub>, your task is to write a program to calculate the number of points which are in the vicinity of point p<sub>i</sub>. </p>

### 입력 

 <p>The first line contains an integer n (2≤ n ≤ 1000) which determines the number of points. The following n lines contain two integers which correspond to the coordinates (x<sub>i</sub>,y<sub>i</sub>) of each point (-10<sup>6 </sup>≤ x<sub>i</sub>, y<sub>i</sub> ≤ 10<sup>6</sup>). Then, the following line includes t (1≤ t ≤ 50) indicating the number of test cases, followed by t lines and each line contains 2 positive integers i (1≤ i ≤ n) and d<sub>v</sub> (1 ≤ d<sub>v</sub> ≤ 100) which indicate the point p<sub>i</sub> and its vicinity distance, respectively. </p>

### 출력 

 <p>For each test case, print out in a line the number of points in the vicinity of the corresponding point. </p>
