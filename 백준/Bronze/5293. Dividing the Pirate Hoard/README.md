### 문제 설명

<p>After raiding an island N pirates end up with M coins. After the raid everybody gathers coins and puts them together in a community pile, to be divided the next day. During the night one pirate decides to take his share himself. He sneaks his way to the hoard and divides the M coins into N equal piles, with K coins left over. He keeps the extra K coins for himself, hides his pile of coins, and puts the other piles of coins back into a single pile. The other pirates then do the same thing one at a time, each dividing the remaining coins into N piles, taking one pile, and keeping any extra coins to keep the remaining piles even.</p>

<p>Given the number of pirates and coins, find out how many coins each pirate will have his own hidden pile (his equal-sized pile plus remaining coins) and how many coins are left in the community pile at the end of the night.</p>
