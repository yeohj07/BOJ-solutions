### 문제 설명

<p>A charity is having a silent auction where people place bids on a prize without knowing anyone else’s bid. Each bid includes a person’s name and the amount of their bid. After the silent auction is over, the winner is the person who has placed the highest bid. If there is a tie, the person whose bid was placed first wins. Your job is to determine the winner of the silent auction.</p>

The order of the input is the order in which bids were placed.</p>
