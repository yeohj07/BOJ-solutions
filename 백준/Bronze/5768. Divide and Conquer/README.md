### 문제 설명

<p>Given two integers M and N, with 1 ≤ M ≤ N ≤ 5000, you must determine the integer numbers X and Y such that</p>

<ul>
	<li>A. M ≤ X ≤ N; and</li>
	<li>B. Y is the number of divisors of X; and</li>
	<li>C. Y is the largest possible; and</li>
	<li>D. X is the largest possible.</li>
</ul>

### 입력 

 <p>Your program should process several test cases. Each test case is composed by a single line contain- ing the two integers M and N (1 ≤ M ≤ N ≤ 5000). The end of input is indicated by M = N = 0.</p>

<p><em>The input must be read from standard input.</em></p>

### 출력 

 <p>For each test case in the input your program should print a single line, containing the two integers X and Y, separated by a space character.</p>

<p><em>The output must be written to standard output.</em></p>
