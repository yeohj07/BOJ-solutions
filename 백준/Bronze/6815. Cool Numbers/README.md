### 문제 설명

<p>Eric likes interesting numbers like 64. It turns out that 64 is both a square and a cube, since 64 = 8<sup>2</sup> and 64 = 4<sup>3</sup>. Eric calls these numbers cool.</p>

<p>Write a program that helps Eric figure out how many integers in a given range are cool.</p>

### 입력 

 <p>On the first line of input, you are given an integer a such that a ≥ 1 and a ≤ 10<sup>8</sup>. On the second line of input, you are given an integer b such that a ≤ b and b ≤ 10<sup>8</sup>.</p>

### 출력 

 <p>The output should be the number of cool numbers in the range a to b (inclusively: that is, a and b would count as cool numbers in the range if they were actually cool).</p>
