### 문제 설명

<p>When Dr. Orooji was your age, one of the popular TV shows was “Get Smart!” The main character in this show (Maxwell Smart, a secret agent) had a few phrases; we used one such phrase for the title of this problem and we’ll use couple more in the output!</p>

<p>A “prime” number is an integer greater than 1 with only two divisors: 1 and itself; examples include 5, 11 and 23. Given a positive integer, you are to print a message indicating whether the number is a prime or how close it is to a prime.</p>

### 입력 

 <p>The first input line contains a positive integer, n (n ≤ 100), indicating the number of values to check. The values are on the following n input lines, one per line. Each value will be an integer between 2 and 10,000 (inclusive).</p>

### 출력 

 <p>At the beginning of each test case, output “Input value: v” where v is the input value. Then, on the next output line, print one of the following two messages:</p>

<ul>
	<li>If the number is a prime, print “Would you believe it; it is a prime!”</li>
	<li>If the number is not a prime, print “Missed it by that much (d)!” where d shows how close the number is to a prime number (note that the closest prime number may be smaller or larger than the given number).</li>
</ul>

<p>Leave a blank line after the output for each test case. Follow the format illustrated in Sample Output.</p>
