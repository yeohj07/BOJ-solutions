### 문제 설명

<p>A palindrome is a sequence of two or more characters that reads the same both forward and backward.  Palindromes can appear inside a longer text, such as “Happy days are here again.” in which “pp”, “ehe” and “ere” are some of the palindromes (ignoring spaces, punctuation, and case). An anti-palindrome is a sequence of two or more characters in which there are no palindromes. You are given text that may contain, or itself form, a palindrome. Your task is to determine if there are any palindromes in the text, in which case declare "Palindrome", or if there are none, declare "Anti-palindrome".  The text may contain spaces, as well as alphabetic and other non-alphabetic characters.  All non-alphabetic characters should be ignored, and uppercase and lowercase letters are considered the same when detecting palindromes.</p>

### 입력 

 <p>The input consists of one line of text as specified above.  The input line will not be longer than 80 characters, and contains at least one alphabetic character.</p>

### 출력 

 <p>Print "Palindrome" if the text contains or is itself a palindrome, or "Anti-palindrome" if there are no palindromes in the text.</p>
