### 문제 설명

<p>Roy has a stack of student yearbook photos. He wants to lay the pictures on a flat surface edge-to-edge to form a filled rectangle with minimum perimeter. All photos must be fully visible. Each picture is a square with dimensions 1 unit by 1 unit.</p>

<p>For example, he would place 12 photos in the following configuration, where each photo is indicated with an <code>X</code>.</p>

<pre>XXXX
XXXX
XXXX</pre>

<p>Of course, he could orient them in the other direction, such as</p>

<pre>XXX
XXX
XXX
XXX</pre>

<p>which would have the same perimeter, 14 units.</p>

<p>Your program should repeatedly read a positive integer $C$, the number of pictures to be laid out. For each input, it should print the smallest possible perimeter for a filled rectangle that is formed by laying all the pictures edge-to-edge. Also print the dimensions of this rectangle.</p>

<p>You may assume that there are less than $65\,000$ photos. An input value of $C = 0$ indicates that the program should terminate.</p>
