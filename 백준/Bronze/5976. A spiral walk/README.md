### 문제 설명

<p>Oh how the cows love to walk in their square pasture with sides of length N (1 <= N <= 750) and which is partitioned into N*N squares. They enjoy the sights, the smells, and the general ambience of the grass and trees.</p>

<p>Bessie has decided to take the cows on the longest possible walk from the upper left corner to the center (or near the center when N is even) of the pasture, passing through each and every square along the way after starting.</p>

<p>She has decided to create the obvious clockwise spiral route (example below) for this evening's stroll. Write a program to create a map for her that shows the order of squares she should visit.</p>

<p>By way of example, for pastures of size N=3 and N=4, here are the routes Bessie should use:</p>

<pre>      1  2  3        1  2  3  4
      8  9  4       12 13 14  5
      7  6  5       11 16 15  6
                    10  9  8  7</pre>

### 입력 

 <p>Line 1: A single integer: N</p>

<p> </p>

### 출력 

 <p>Lines 1..N: N space-separated integers</p>

<p> </p>
