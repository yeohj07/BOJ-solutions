### 문제 설명

<p>You own a company that hires painters to paint houses. You can hire as many painters as you want, but for every painter you hire, you have to pay X dollars (independent of how long the painter works on the house). In addition, you have to pay a penalty of D · P dollars overall if it takes D days to finish painting the house. This penalty does not depend on the number of painters you hire; furthermore, even if the time taken is not a whole number of days, you are only penalized for the exact time taken.</p>

<p>All painters paint at the same rate. One painter can finish painting the house in K days. The painters cooperate so well that it will only take K/M days for M painters to finish painting the house.</p>

<p>What is the minimum amount of money you will have to pay, including what you pay to the painters and the cost penalty, to get a house painted?</p>

### 입력 

 <p>The input consists of a single line containing three space-separated integers K, P, and X (1 ≤ K, P, X ≤ 10,000).</p>

### 출력 

 <p>Print, on a single line, the minimum cost to have the house painted, rounded and displayed to exactly three decimal places.</p>
