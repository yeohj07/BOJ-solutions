<p>You are to write a program that reads the coordinates of a point (x, y), and writes the number (if any) that has been written at that point. (x, y) coordinates in the input are in the range 0...5000.</p>

### 입력 

 <p>The first line of the input is N, the number of test cases for this problem. In each of the N following lines, there is x, and y representing the coordinates (x, y) of a point.</p>

### 출력 

 <p>For each point in the input, write the number written at that point or write "No Number" if there is none.</p>
