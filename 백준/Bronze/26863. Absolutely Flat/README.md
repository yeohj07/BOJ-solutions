### 문제 설명

<p>Alice is a proud owner of a four-legged table, and she wants her table to be flat. Alice considers the table to be flat if its four legs have equal lengths. </p>

<p>Alice measured the table's current leg lengths and got $a_1, a_2, a_3$, and $a_4$. She also has a pad of length $b$. Alice can attach the pad to one of the legs, in which case the length of that leg will increase by $b$. She can also decide not to attach the pad, in which case the lengths of the legs will not change. Note that Alice has just a single pad, so she can neither apply it twice to the same leg nor apply it to two different legs.</p>

<p>Find out whether Alice can make her table flat.</p>

### 입력 

 <p>The input contains five positive integers $a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4$, and $b$, each on a separate line --- the lengths of the table's legs, and the length of the pad Alice has ($1 \le a_i, b \le 100$).</p>

### 출력 

 <p>Print $1$ if Alice can make her table flat, and $0$ otherwise.</p>
